# Transformer Lab CLI

Use the `lab` CLI to interact with Transformer Lab programmatically — managing tasks, jobs, compute providers, models, datasets, and server configuration from the terminal.

## Installation

```bash
uv tool install transformerlab-cli
# or
pip install transformerlab-cli
```

Verify: `lab version`

## First-Time Setup & Authentication

**If the CLI returns `Missing required configuration keys: team_id, user_email` (or any other auth/config error), do NOT ask the user for an API key.** Instead, tell them to run:

```bash
lab login
```

This launches the interactive login flow in their terminal. Wait for them to complete it, then retry the original command. Never prompt the user to paste an API key into the conversation.

**The CLI only supports API key authentication.** There is no `--email` or `--password` flag. To connect:

```bash
# Step 1: Set the server (if not using default localhost)
lab config set server https://your-server-url

# Step 2: Login with an API key
lab login --api-key YOUR_API_KEY --server https://your-server-url

# Step 3: Set the current experiment
lab config set current_experiment your_experiment_name

# Step 4: Verify connectivity
lab status
```

`login` validates the key and automatically configures `server`, `team_id`, `user_email`, and `team_name`.

**Getting an API key:** If `lab status` fails with auth errors, **stop and ask the user to provide an API key.** Do NOT attempt to create API keys programmatically by logging in with email/password. API keys are created in the Transformer Lab web UI under team settings. The user must provide the key to you.

### Verifying You're Connected to the Right Server

After login, always verify:

```bash
lab config        # Shows server URL, team, user, experiment
lab status        # Shows server version and connectivity
lab whoami        # Confirms authenticated user and team
```

If `lab status` returns errors but `curl -s https://SERVER/` returns 200, the issue is likely auth — re-run `lab login`.

## Critical: `--format` Flag Placement

The `--format` flag is a **root-level option** and MUST come immediately after `lab`, before any subcommand:

```bash
# CORRECT
lab --format json job list
lab --format json task info 42

# WRONG — will be ignored or cause an error
lab job list --format json
```

## Core Workflow

The standard pattern for working with Transformer Lab:

```bash
# 1. Check server is up
lab status

# 2. List available tasks
lab task list

# 3. Queue a task on a compute provider
#    NOTE: --no-interactive silently picks the DEFAULT provider (Local).
#    To pick a specific provider, run interactively (see "Selecting a provider" below).
#    ALWAYS pass --description/-m with a markdown note describing the iteration
#    (see "Always write a run description" below).
lab task queue TASK_ID --no-interactive -m "Testing lr=3e-5 after loss plateaued at 2.1"

# 4. Monitor the job (three log streams — see "Job logs: three real commands" below)
lab job list --running
lab job task-logs JOB_ID --follow      # Lab SDK output (lab.log, progress) — start here
lab job machine-logs JOB_ID --follow   # Raw process stdout+stderr from the remote node
lab job request-logs JOB_ID --follow   # Provider launch/provisioning logs (e.g. SkyPilot)

# 5. Download results
lab job artifacts JOB_ID
lab job download JOB_ID --file "*.csv" -o ./results
```

## Creating Tasks

### Scaffold a new task with `lab task init`

**When the user asks to create, initialize, or start a new task, always use `lab task init`** rather than writing `task.yaml` / `main.py` by hand. It scaffolds both files with sensible defaults in the current directory so the user has a working starting point.

```bash
mkdir my-task && cd my-task
lab task init            # writes task.yaml + main.py with defaults (skips existing files)
lab task init --interactive   # prompts for name, CPUs, memory, setup, and run command
```

- Default mode is non-interactive. It creates `task.yaml` (with `name`, `resources: {cpus: 2, memory: 4}`, and `run: python main.py`) and a starter `main.py`. Existing files are skipped, not overwritten.
- `--interactive` writes only `task.yaml` (no `main.py`) and prompts for each field. In this mode `task.yaml` will prompt before overwrite.
- After init, edit `main.py`, customize `task.yaml`, then run `lab task add .` to create it on the server.

### task.yaml Structure

Full docs: https://lab.cloud/for-teams/running-a-task/task-yaml-structure

```yaml
name: my-task                          # Required — task identifier
resources:                             # Optional but recommended
  cpus: 2                              # CPU count (integer or string)
  memory: 4                            # RAM in GB (integer or string, NOT "4Gi")
  disk_space: 100                      # Storage in GB
  accelerators: "H100:8"              # GPU spec as "TYPE:COUNT"
  num_nodes: 2                         # For distributed training
  compute_provider: my-provider        # Target provider name
setup: |                               # Optional — runs before main task
  pip install transformerlab
  pip install -r requirements.txt
run: python main.py                    # Required — main entry point
envs:                                  # Optional environment variables
  HF_TOKEN: "${HF_TOKEN}"
parameters:                            # Optional — accessible via lab.get_config()
  learning_rate: 0.001
  batch_size: 32
sweeps:                                # Optional — hyperparameter sweep
  sweep_config:
    learning_rate: ["1e-5", "3e-5"]
  sweep_metric: "eval/loss"
  lower_is_better: true
minutes_requested: 60                  # Optional time limit
github_repo_url: https://...           # Optional — clone from git
github_repo_dir: path/in/repo
github_repo_branch: main
```

**Important:** `memory` and `disk_space` are plain numbers in GB (e.g., `4`, `16`), NOT Kubernetes-style strings like `4Gi`. The schema accepts both but the canonical format is plain integers.

### Validation

`lab task add` automatically validates task.yaml against the server schema before creating the task. There is no standalone `lab task validate` command yet (TODO: add one).

To validate without creating, use `lab task add ./my-task --dry-run`.

### Editing task.yaml for an existing task

Use `lab task edit` to update the `task.yaml` for a task that already exists on the server:

```bash
# Interactive editor flow
lab task edit TASK_ID

# Apply a local task.yaml directly
lab task edit TASK_ID --from-file ./task.yaml --no-interactive
```

`lab task edit` expects a `TASK_ID` and supports `--from-file`, `--no-interactive`, and `--timeout`.

### Uploading extra files to an existing task

Use `lab task upload` to upload files or directories into an existing task:

```bash
# Upload a single file
lab task upload TASK_ID ./tokenizer.json

# Upload a directory
lab task upload TASK_ID ./prompts --no-interactive
```

`lab task upload` requires both `TASK_ID` and `PATH`.

### Lab SDK Quick Reference

Tasks use the Lab SDK (`transformerlab` PyPI package). Import pattern:

```python
from lab import lab

lab.init()                                    # Required — connects to the job
lab.log("message")                            # Write to job output log
lab.update_progress(50)                       # Set progress 0-100
config = lab.get_config()                     # Read parameters from task.yaml

lab.finish(message="Done!")                   # Mark job as SUCCESS
lab.error(message="Something went wrong")     # Mark job as FAILED
```

**Common mistakes:**
- `lab.finish()` has NO `status` parameter — just `message`. For failures, use `lab.error()`.
- Always call `lab.init()` before any other SDK call.
- Always call `lab.finish()` or `lab.error()` at the end — otherwise the job stays in RUNNING state.

### Example: Minimal Hello World Task

**task.yaml:**
```yaml
name: hello-world
setup: pip install transformerlab
run: python main.py
resources:
  cpus: 2
  memory: 4
```

**main.py:**
```python
import time
from lab import lab

lab.init()
lab.log("Hello from Transformer Lab!")
lab.update_progress(25)
time.sleep(3)
lab.log("Working...")
lab.update_progress(75)
time.sleep(2)
lab.log("Done!")
lab.update_progress(100)
lab.finish(message="Hello world complete!")
```

**Add it:**
```bash
lab task add ./hello-world-task --no-interactive
```

## Managing Models

Use `lab model` commands to list, inspect, create, edit, and delete model groups on the server. Models are organized as **groups** — each group can contain multiple versions (e.g. v1, v2, …).

```bash
# List all model groups
lab --format json model list

# Get details for a specific model (by group_id or group_name)
lab --format json model info GROUP_ID

# Register a new model (e.g. a HuggingFace model ID)
lab --format json model create my-hf-model-id --name "My Fine-tuned Model" --description "SFT on custom data"

# Edit a model group's name or description
lab model edit GROUP_ID --name "New Name" --description "Updated description"

# Delete a model group and all its versions (--yes to skip confirmation)
lab model delete GROUP_ID --yes
```

### Publishing a model from a job

After a training job completes, publish its output model to the registry:

```bash
# Interactive — prompts for model name, group, mode, tag
lab job publish model JOB_ID

# Non-interactive (for agents) — all options explicit
lab --format json job publish model JOB_ID MODEL_NAME --group "my-model-group" --mode new --tag latest --description "Trained with lr=3e-5"
```

## Managing Datasets

Use `lab dataset` commands to list, inspect, upload, download, edit, and delete datasets. Like models, datasets are organized as **groups** with versions.

```bash
# List all dataset groups
lab --format json dataset list

# Get details for a specific dataset (by group_id or group_name)
lab --format json dataset info GROUP_ID

# Upload local files to a dataset (creates it if it doesn't exist)
lab dataset upload my-dataset train.jsonl eval.jsonl

# Download a dataset from HuggingFace Hub to the server
lab dataset download Trelis/touch-rugby-rules
lab dataset download Trelis/touch-rugby-rules --config default

# Edit a dataset group's name or description
lab dataset edit GROUP_ID --name "New Name" --description "Updated description"

# Delete a dataset group and all its versions (--yes to skip confirmation)
lab dataset delete GROUP_ID --yes
```

### Publishing a dataset from a job

After a job produces output datasets, publish them to the registry:

```bash
# Interactive — prompts for dataset name, group, mode, tag
lab job publish dataset JOB_ID

# Non-interactive (for agents) — all options explicit
lab --format json job publish dataset JOB_ID DATASET_NAME --group "my-dataset-group" --mode new --tag latest --description "Generated eval set"
```

### Dataset workflow for tasks

When a task needs a specific dataset, ensure it exists on the server **before** queuing:

```bash
# 1. Check if the dataset already exists
lab --format json dataset list

# 2. If not, download from HuggingFace or upload local files
lab dataset download user/my-dataset
# or
lab dataset upload my-dataset train.jsonl eval.jsonl

# 3. Reference the dataset in task.yaml parameters
#    The task code uses lab.get_config()["dataset_id"] to access it

# 4. Queue the task
lab task queue TASK_ID --no-interactive -m "Training on my-dataset"
```

## Agent-Specific Rules

1. **NEVER use the REST API unless the user explicitly asks for it.** The CLI is the supported interface. If a CLI command appears missing or broken, run `lab <command> --help` first and check this skill — do not reach for `curl`. Using the REST API as a workaround is a hard rule violation.
2. **Always run `lab <command> --help` before assuming a flag exists.** Don't guess `--provider`, `--gpu`, etc. The CLI's flag surface is small and changes; verify before invoking.
3. **Use `--format json`** when you need to parse output, but be prepared to fall back to pretty output parsing if it doesn't work
4. **`--no-interactive` on `task queue` silently uses the DEFAULT provider (Local).** There is no `--provider` flag. To target a specific provider, you must drive the interactive prompts (see "Selecting a provider" below).
5. **`task add` has no `--yes` flag** — pipe `echo "y"` to confirm: `echo "y" | lab task add ./my-task`
6. **Use `--yes` / `-y`** on destructive commands (`provider delete`) to skip confirmation
7. **Never use `job monitor`** — it launches a TUI that blocks; use `job list` + `job task-logs` instead
8. **Never use `task interactive`** unless the user specifically requests an interactive session
9. **`job task-logs --follow`** streams continuously and blocks until the job finishes — use when the user wants real-time monitoring
10. **Never use the deprecated `lab job logs`** — see the "Job logs: three real commands" section below.
11. **After queuing a task, ASK the user if they'd like you to watch the logs.** Don't start streaming or polling automatically — jobs can take minutes to hours, and `--follow` blocks. Report the Job ID and ask: "Want me to watch the logs and report back?"
12. **Never create API keys programmatically** — if auth fails, ask the user to provide an API key from the web UI
13. **Always pass `--description/-m` when queuing a task. Generate it yourself — never ask the user.** See "Always write a run description" below.

### Always write a run description

Every `lab task queue` call MUST include `--description/-m "..."`. The description is markdown stored on the job and shown in `lab job info`. Its audience is a future researcher reading `lab job list` weeks later — they have git and the task code, but NOT this chat. The description is the only bridge.

**Treat it like a short PR description for this run.** Draft 1–5 lines (bullets for multi-point notes) covering:

1. **What changed vs the prior run / baseline** — the concrete diff (hyperparameters, code, model, data, infra). If nothing changed, say so and link the prior job.
2. **What hypothesis you're testing** — why this run is worth doing.
3. **What a future reader should remember** — gotchas, prior surprises, things to check in the output.

Pull these from the conversation and recent git diff / edited files. If the note has newlines or shell-awkward characters, pipe it: `printf '%s' "$DESC" | lab task queue abc123 -m -`.

```bash
# Good: diff + hypothesis + watch
printf '%s' "- Bumped lr 1e-5 → 3e-5, warmup 100 → 500 steps.
- Testing whether higher lr clears the eval/loss=2.1 plateau seen in job 7f21 around step 2k.
- Watch: earlier runs with lr≥5e-5 diverged by step 500." | lab task queue abc123 --no-interactive -m -

# Good: small change — one line is enough
lab task queue abc123 --no-interactive -m "Rerun on H100 (was A100) to confirm throughput regression from #1850."

# Good: nothing changed
lab task queue abc123 --no-interactive -m "Rerun of job 7f21, no code or config changes (network flake on first attempt)."

# Bad: generic filler that tells the reader nothing
lab task queue abc123 -m "train model"
```

Don't restate the task name, full hyperparameter dict, or file paths — those are already on the job record. Don't copy the user's last message verbatim — synthesize. If the conversation is truly empty of signal, fall back to `"Rerun of <id>, no changes"`.

### Selecting a provider when queuing a task

`lab task queue` has no `--provider` flag. With `--no-interactive` it picks the default (usually Local). To pick a specific provider, drive the interactive prompts via stdin. The flow is:

1. "Use these resource requirements? [Y/n]" → answer `y`
2. "Available Providers: 1. Local  2. skypilot1 ... Select a provider [1]:" → answer the number

```bash
# Pick provider #2 (skypilot1) with default resources
printf "y\n2\n" | lab task queue TASK_ID
```

Run `lab provider list` first to confirm the numbering before piping.

### Job logs: three real commands

`lab job logs` is **deprecated** — do not use it. There are three distinct log commands, each surfacing a different layer:

| Command | What it shows | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `lab job task-logs JOB_ID` | Task (Lab SDK) output — what `lab.log()` recorded | Default for "what did my task do?" — covers `lab.log`, progress, completion |
| `lab job machine-logs JOB_ID` | Machine/provider stdout+stderr from the remote node | When the task crashed before SDK init, or you need raw process output |
| `lab job request-logs JOB_ID` | Provider request/launch logs (e.g. SkyPilot launch/provisioning) | When the cluster never started, or to debug provisioning failures |

All three accept `--follow` to stream continuously. Start with `task-logs`; escalate to `machine-logs` for crashes outside the SDK, and `request-logs` for cluster/provisioning issues.

## Debugging Failed Jobs

**Job COMPLETE does not mean the task succeeded.** Always check `completion_status` and `completion_details`:

```bash
# CLI: check job info for completion details
lab job info JOB_ID
# Look for: Completion Status (success/failed/N/A) and Completion Details

# CLI: get logs (see "Job logs: three real commands" above)
lab job task-logs JOB_ID      # task/SDK output
lab job machine-logs JOB_ID   # raw process stdout+stderr
lab job request-logs JOB_ID   # provider launch/provisioning logs
```

**Do NOT fall back to the REST API** if a log command returns empty — try the other two log commands first. The three layers surface different things; sparse output from one doesn't mean failure.

**Common failure patterns:**

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Status COMPLETE but completion_status is N/A, progress 0% | Task never actually ran (wrong GPU type, cluster not found) | Check cluster status, verify accelerator type exists on provider |
| Status FAILED, "No such file or directory" in logs | Wrong `run` command path | Check where files are placed (see File Mounts section) |
| Status FAILED with a Python traceback | Task code error | Read the full provider logs to see the traceback |
| Status FAILED, no logs available | Cluster failed to provision | Check if the requested accelerator type is available |

### Checking Cluster Status (SkyPilot providers)

Use `lab job info JOB_ID` — it shows `cluster_name` and provisioning state. For more detail use `lab job request-logs JOB_ID` (provider launch logs). If a cluster never provisioned, the request-logs will show why (wrong accelerator type, quota, etc.).

## Do NOT use the REST API

The CLI is the supported, sanctioned interface. **Never call the REST API directly with `curl` unless the user explicitly asks you to.** If the CLI seems to be missing a capability:

1. Run `lab <command> --help` and `lab <subcommand> --help` to verify
2. Re-read this skill for the right pattern (e.g. interactive prompts via stdin)
3. Tell the user the CLI doesn't support it — don't silently switch to `curl`

This applies to launching jobs, fetching logs, checking cluster status, and everything else.

## JSON Output Shapes

**`lab --format json job list`** returns an array:
```json
[{"id": "uuid", "status": "COMPLETE", "progress": 100, "job_data": {...}, "created_at": "..."}]
```

**`lab --format json task list`** returns an array:
```json
[{"id": "uuid", "name": "my-task", "type": "REMOTE", ...}]
```

**Errors** return:
```json
{"error": "error message here"}
```

With non-zero exit code.

## Error Handling

- Commands exit with non-zero status on failure
- With `--format json`, errors return `{"error": "<message>"}`
- "config not set" errors → run `lab login` first
- "current_experiment not set" → run `lab config set current_experiment <id>`
- Connection refused → check server URL with `lab config`, verify server is running
- "No compute providers available" → add a provider in team settings first, or check `provider list`

## When to Use CLI vs REST API vs Browser

| Use CLI for | Use REST API for | Use Browser for |
|---|---|---|
| Login, config, status checks | Launching jobs when CLI fails | Creating experiments |
| Listing tasks and jobs | Getting provider logs | Configuring tasks via forms |
| Streaming job logs (`--follow`) | Checking cluster status | Visual UI verification |
| Adding tasks from local dirs | Any operation where CLI returns errors | Creating API keys |
| Downloading artifacts | Debugging failed jobs | Managing team settings |

**When to fall back to REST API:** If any CLI command returns "Not Found", "Method Not Allowed", or "No compute providers available", the server API may have changed. Use the OpenAPI spec (`/openapi.json`) to find correct endpoints and call them directly with `curl`.
